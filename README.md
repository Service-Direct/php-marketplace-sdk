# php-partners-sdk

A PHP library for integration with Service Direct's Partners API.

Things you can do with this API:

* Use the `examples\request-bid.php` file to tell Service Direct about phone leads of a certain
  service category (e.g. Plumbing, Air Conditioning, etc...), and see whether Service Direct is
  interested in bidding on your lead.
* Use the `examples\request-aquire.php` file if you accept our bid and want to forward us the call.
  We'll respond with a phone number for you to forward the call to.

See the `examples` directory for the usage.
